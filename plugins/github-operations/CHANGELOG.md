# Changelog

All notable changes to **GitHub Operations** are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/2.0.0/), and this plugin adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `git-cleanup` inventory: `--from` with a saved file that is not a JSON object now reports a JSON error and exits 0, instead of ending with a traceback.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-15

### Added

- `github-operations:auto-pr-lifecycle` skill: takes a pull request from any stage to merge. It validates and pushes your work, opens or finds the PR, sends the `pr-tracker` agent to watch the checks and reviews, fixes what fails, answers review threads and repeats until the PR is ready, then asks for your approval for that exact commit before it merges, deletes the branch and syncs.
- `github-operations:pr-tracker` agent: a read-only monitor with no shell. It reports failed jobs with their step and log excerpt, job durations, review findings, deprecation warnings and Dependabot alerts, with each cause labeled confirmed, likely or uncertain.
- `github-operations:pr-diagnostics` skill: the inspection procedure and report format the agent follows, preloaded into it.
- The GitHub MCP server, bundled, with two options: `github_token` and `github_mcp_url`. The default URL offers every toolset.
- `github-operations:git-cleanup` skill, started only with `/github-operations:git-cleanup [path] [problem]`: audits a repository end to end (context, every local and remote branch with its exclusive work, linked worktrees, stashes, pull requests, files and noise, history, reflog), presents findings and a numbered cleanup plan with a mandatory backup that is part of every approval, and executes and verifies only the actions you approve. It includes the read-only `inventory.py` and a `PreToolUse` guard that refuses force-pushes, deleting `main` on the remote, history-rewriting tools, `git clean -x`, default-branch changes and secret reads, and asks before every command that changes state.

### Changed

- **Git Hygiene is now part of this plugin.** Its `cleanup` skill is `git-cleanup`: type `/github-operations:git-cleanup` where you used to type `/git-hygiene:cleanup`. The marketplace renames the old plugin, so existing installs move over. The temporary backup refs are now `refs/git-cleanup-backup/*` and the guard's messages start with `git-cleanup:`.
