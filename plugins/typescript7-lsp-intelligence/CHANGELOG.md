## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-12

### Added

- Language server: connects Claude Code to the native TypeScript 7 server (`tsc --lsp --stdio`) for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs` and `.cjs` files, with diagnostics after each edit and restart on crash.
- `typescript7-lsp-intelligence` skill: navigates TypeScript and JavaScript with the language server; checks program membership and effective configuration before trusting a diagnostic; tells TypeScript 6 `tsserver` tooling apart from the TypeScript 7 native server; fixes compiler findings by narrowing `unknown` instead of using assertions, `any` or suppressions; and reports each check's status, the programs covered and what stayed unverified.
- Optional controls: a bundled runner compiles known control files with the compiler you choose, in a temporary folder, without running them or installing anything.
