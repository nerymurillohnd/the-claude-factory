# 🧾 Pending Debt

> [!NOTE]
> Unresolved technical or maintenance conditions that cannot be fixed now. Each one has evidence, an owner and a way out. Fixed items move to `resolved-debt.md`.

## 🎯 Entry criteria

Add an item only when all of these hold:

- A specific condition is observable or backed by traceable evidence. No speculation.
- It has a real operational, security, reliability, compatibility or maintainability impact.
- It cannot be fixed now: it waits on a decision, access, spend or an external party, or the risk is accepted on purpose.
- A concrete next action exists, or a concrete condition that triggers reassessment.
- No other active record tracks it, such as an open issue or an ADR follow-up.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not add improvement ideas, speculation or a copy of the backlog. A problem that can be fixed now gets fixed, not logged.

## 🔄 Record maintenance

| Action | When | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ➕ Append | A new condition appears | Search both ledgers for the same condition first. |
| ✏️ Update | Evidence, impact, owner or next action changes | Revise in place. Keep confirmed facts apart from inference. |
| ✅ Resolve | The fix is verified | Move the entry to `resolved-debt.md` with the same ID. Never just delete it. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An item moves to resolved debt only after the fix works and the original failure no longer reproduces.

### DEBT-001 — pr-tracker gets no GitHub tools when the GitHub MCP server has another name

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Status** | 🟡 Pending |
| **Category** | compatibility, reliability |
| **Owner** | `plugins/github-operations` (agent `pr-tracker`, skill `auto-pr-lifecycle`) |
| **Logged** | 2026-10-19 |

#### 🔎 Evidence

- **Confirmed facts:**
  - `plugins/github-operations/agents/pr-tracker.md` (plugin 0.3.1) sets `tools:` to `ToolSearch` plus exact MCP tool names under two prefixes only: `mcp__plugin_github-operations_github__*` and `mcp__github__*`.
  - On 2026-10-19, in a Claude Code desktop (Code tab) session on PR #22, the session's GitHub tools were named `mcp__650eb531-f579-4af8-a637-6ce6bd506b6b__*`, and no `mcp__plugin_github-operations_github__*` tool was loaded. The `pr-tracker` launched with only `ToolSearch` (plus its hand-back tool), found no GitHub tool and reported `BLOCKED` with nothing inspected; the main session observed the PR with `gh` instead.
  - The loaded copy in that session was `github-operations@synced` 0.3.0; the repository's 0.3.1 has the same fixed-name list, so the published version is affected too.
  - `claude mcp list` in the CLI shows `plugin:github-operations:github` connected with the token set, so the CLI tracker gets its tools.
  - https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents ("Restrict which tools a subagent can use"): `tools` is an allowlist resolved against the session's pool; `disallowedTools` is a denylist that keeps MCP tools inherited; when nothing in `tools` resolves, Claude Code usually refuses to launch the subagent. Here `ToolSearch` resolved, so it launched.
  - https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks: plugin `PreToolUse` hooks fire inside subagents, and the input carries `agent_type`.
- **Inferences:** the `650eb531-…` server is the GitHub connector Nery added in the Claude app (not verified). Any user who turns the plugin on in the Claude app, connects the connector and works in the desktop Code tab gets a blind tracker, because the connector's UUID name is unpredictable.
- **Open questions:** why the desktop session did not load the plugin's own `github` server alongside the connector; whether `agent_type` for a plugin agent arrives as `github-operations:pr-tracker` (to test live).

#### 📈 Impact and next step

- **Impact / risk:** in that setup the PR lifecycle loses its monitoring agent; every tracker round is wasted and the main session must observe with `gh`. The tracker reports the gap honestly, so there is no false "clean" result.
- **Why it is not fixed now:** one open task at a time: svelte-development (PR #22) is in progress, and Nery chose to fix github-operations after it merges (2026-10-19).
- **Next action:** fix option A in github-operations, chosen by Nery: replace `tools:` with `disallowedTools: Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, Bash, PowerShell, Agent` so the agent inherits GitHub tools under any server name; add a `PreToolUse` hook in the plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` that blocks write MCP methods (merge, create, update, delete, resolve, rerun) when `agent_type` is the tracker; have `auto-pr-lifecycle` check which GitHub MCP prefix the session has before delegating and go to `gh` when none matches. Test the hook live, including the `agent_type` value.
- **Review condition:** closes when the tracker, run from the desktop Code tab with only the Claude app connector, reads a PR's checks and reviews, and its write calls are blocked by the hook.
- **Related records:** PR #22 (where it was observed); ADR_2026-10-18_fold-pr-diagnostics-into-pr-tracker.
